#Rhapsode

This is an experiment in figuring out how to make a simple blog. The aim is to create my lightsaber, so to speak, and start being a contributing member of the world ;)

##Design Considerations

Decisions made up front to guide the design:
* Backend -> Clojure 
* Frontend -> AngularJs
* Posts to be stored as markdown documents in the file system.
* nginx for proxying

Aim is to make the publish process be done by simply putting a .md file in a directory.
